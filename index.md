## ReCO2ST Business model kit's guide
Buildings energy consumption in Europe represents more than 40% of the final energy consumption. The most challenging aspect of reducing energy use in building is in increasing the rate, quality, and effectiveness of building renovation since the current rate of renovation is only 1.2% per year and should increase by a factor of two to three to reach the EU 2030 targets. However, residential building retrofitting is not taking up. Among many different barriers, there is a lack of knowledge on the demand side, as Owners are not able to answer the multiple questions they are confronted with when initiating a renovation project. This Guidance document and its associated Toolkit aims to help the end-user in his decision- making process to retrofit residential multi buildings, ultimately, towards a NZEB (Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings) target.

Regarding Global Building Renovation, different views exist from the private owner, public authorities to experts in the domain. Each person has different issues, and the BMK (Business Model Kit) tries to answer them. This document is split into 6 different volumes. Access to the volumes and/or to their different parts may be granted from various links in the following sections
