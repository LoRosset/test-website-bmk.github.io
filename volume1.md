## Volume 1

### Audience

This Guide is primarily dedicated to those aiming at renovating large residential Buildings with a view of drastically reducing their carbon footprint. Such refurbishment projects are - by essence - quite complex as they encompass many disconnected disciplines, requesting a very high level of proficiency in many of them. Few important aspects to meet such challenge are legal, finance, building physics, building construction, controls & AI, project management, risk analysis. Therefore, the audience of such a guidance may be quite large and may cover many different specialized expertise fields and numerous readers familiar to only few of them. 
Quite far from being an exhaustive compendium of all these knowledge fields, this guide attempts to bridge the gap - as a sort of bootstrap tool- between common basic property management know- how and the stage at which an efficient NZEB refurbishment risk transfer may be initiated. Indeed, mastering these multiple aspects requires experienced professionals and improvisation is likely to result in failure. This paper tries to give some practical guidance to owners and/or decision makers, to answer questions like: How to select these professionals? What is the least cost approach to reach the NZEB targets? What should be subcontracted? How to mitigate the investor’s risk into a manageable one? Which contractual route best suits my approach? It also may be useful to professionals in order to understand the motivations of their clients, prior to any serious attempt to contract with them on NZEB Projects. These Owners, decision makers or even professionals are all analyzed on the “Variety of Stakeholders/ Building and Ownership Definition Type of Ownership” chapter as different personas based on ReCO2ST customer segments.

### The 6 Volumes
Ultimately, the goal of this document is to help a decision maker in the initial renovation stages to reach its NZEB targets, finding the best possible combination of professional partners, the most efficient contractual route(s) given the present owner's situation, properly delegating the risks and assuring that the NZEB commitments will be achievable and durable.
This document is split into six Volumes. the present volume is the entry level which is aimed at guiding the reader through all the other Volumes, detailing the different concepts.
